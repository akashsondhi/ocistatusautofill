Adding a local extension to Chrome involves a few steps. Hereâ€™s a straightforward guide to help you do it:

1. Download the Extension Files:
    Ensure you have the extension files in a compressed format (ZIP or CRX).
    If it's a ZIP file, extract its contents to a folder on your computer.
2. Open Chrome Extensions Management:
    Type chrome://extensions/ into the address bar of Chrome and press Enter. This will open the Extensions page.
3. Enable Developer Mode:
    In the top right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on the Developer mode switch.
4. Load the Extension:
    After enabling Developer mode, you'll see three buttons appear. Click on Load unpacked.
    A file dialog box will open. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files, and select the folder (or the extension's manifest file if it's in that form). Click Select Folder (or Open depending on your operating system).
5. Confirm the Extension is Added:
    Once you select the folder, Chrome will load the extension. You should see its icon appear in the extensions toolbar next to the address bar.
6. Verify and Manage:
    After loading, the extension will be active. You can manage its settings, disable, or remove it like any other Chrome extension from the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
